## Description

I have given a functional Express.js API

Upon adding my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize.

After I entered my schema and seed commands so a development database is created and is seeded with test data.

Upon entering the command to invoke the application my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database.

After I open API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags and the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON.

Following the previous step I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia and I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database.
